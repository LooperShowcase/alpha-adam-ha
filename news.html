      on the tongues of many in Netflix’s new series Vikings: Valhalla. This new
      installment takes place roughly 100 years after the events of the History
      Channel’s Vikings, bringing back some famous landmarks from the original
      with an all-new cast of characters. Although generations have passed,
      Ragnar’s influence can still be felt in many ways, his legacy a driving
      force for Vikings of every faction. Valhalla is on the same timeline as
      Vikings, now focusing on a new generation of Vikings and Saxons and a new
      war of vengeance that grips their nations. After an order from King
      Aethelred to eradicate all Vikings from Saxon lands, King Canute and
      Prince Harald Sigurdsson form an army of Danes to seek revenge for their
      slaughtered brethren. Leif Eriksson, Greenlander and son of famous
      berserker Erik the Red, is roped into the quarrel by circumstance,
      reluctantly leading the Viking army into the annals of history.
